# Code of Conduct 

We are committed to providing a safe, inclusive, welcoming, and harassment-free experience for everyone.

We try to cultivate a community with shared values, where people are comfortable exploring ideas, asking questions, and saying things like "I don't understand" or "why". Assume competence in the people you interact with. There are no stupid questions.

Be considerate in speech and actions, and actively seek to acknowledge and respect the boundaries of fellow participants.

Take care of each other. Alert a member of the Code of Conduct Committee (named below) if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or a potential violation of this Code of Conduct, even if it seems inconsequential.

We do not tolerate harassment in any form. Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech. Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

+ offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices
+ unwelcome comments regarding a person's lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, or employment
+ sustained or willful disruption of discussions, talks, or other events
+ deliberate intimidation
+ continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease
+ unwanted photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes
+ pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others
+ inappropriate physical contact without consent or after a request to stop
+ stalking or following
+ threats of violence or incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm
+ use of sexual or discriminatory imagery, comments, or jokes
+ unwelcome sexual attention
+ deliberate "outing" of any aspect of a person's identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse
+ deliberate misgendering or use of "dead" or rejected names
+ publication of non-harassing private communication

This Code of Conduct applies to all people participating in the event, including staff and leadership. It applies to all modes of interaction online including GitHub project repositories, including social gatherings affiliated with the event.
